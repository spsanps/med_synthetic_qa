      "The length constant can be related to the electrical properties of the axon according to cable theory because nerve fibers have many of the properties of an electrical cable. In a perfect cable, the insulation surrounding the core conductor prevents all loss of current to the surrounding medium, so that a signal is transmitted along the cable with undiminished strength. If an unmyelinated nerve fiber (discussed later) is compared to an electrical cable, the plasma membrane equates to the insulation and the cytoplasm as the core conductor, but the plasma membrane is not a perfect insulator. Thus the spread of signals depends on the r\n",
      "atio of the membrane resistance to the axial resistance of the axonal cytoplasm (ra). When the ratio of rm to ra is high, less current is lost across the plasma membrane per unit of axonal length, the axon can function better as a cable, and the distance that a signal can be conveyed electrotonically without significant decrement is longer. A useful analogy is to think of the axon as a garden hose with holes poked in it. The more holes there are in the hose, the more water leaks out along its length (analogous to more loss of current when rm is low) and the less water is delivered to its nozzle. According to cable theory, the length\n",
      " constant can be related to axonal resistance and is equal to rm/ra . This relationship can be used to determine how changes in axonal diameter affect the length constant and, hence, how the decay of electrotonic potentials varies. An increase in the diameter of the axon reduces both ra and rm. However, rm is inversely proportional to diameter (because it is related to the circumference of the axon), whereas ra varies inversely to the diameter squared (because it is related to the cross-sectional area of the axon). Thus ra decreases more rapidly than rm does as axonal diameter increases, and the length constant therefore increases (\n",
