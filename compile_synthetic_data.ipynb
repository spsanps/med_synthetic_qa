Kim Barrett and Helen Raybould (gastrointestinal system), and Dr. Bruce White (endocrine and reproductive systems). We also welcome the following authors: Dr. Withrow Gil Wier (cardiovascular system), and Dr. John Harrison (endocrine and reproduction systems). As in the previous editions of this textbook, we have attempted to emphasize broad concepts and to minimize the compilation of isolated facts. Each chapter has been written to make the text as lucid, accurate, and current as possible. We have included both clinical and molecular information in each section, as feedback on these features has indicated that this information serves to provide clinical context and new insights into physiologic phenomena at the cellular and molecular levels. New to this edition is a list of sources that the reader can consult for further information on the topics covered in each chapter. We hope that you find this a valuable addition to the book.\n",
